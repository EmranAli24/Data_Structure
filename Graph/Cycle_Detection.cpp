/*
--> Hereâ€™s the algorithm to detect cycles in an undirected graph:

1. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from each unvisited vertex
2. During DFS traversal, mark current vertex as visited
3. For each unvisited neighbor from the current vertex:
   ~If the neighbor vertex is not visited, perform DFS on this vertex
   ~If the neighbor vertex is already visited, it means there is a cycle
