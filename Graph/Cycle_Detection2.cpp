/*

Hereâ€™s an algorithm to detect cycles in a directed graph using the white, gray, and black (0, 1, 2) 
marking technique:

1. Initialize all vertices in the graph as white (0).
2. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from vertices still marked as white.
3. During the DFS traversal, mark each vertex as follows:
        --> When a vertex is first visited, mark it as gray (1).
        --> When the DFS has finished exploring all the vertices
           reachable from the current vertex, mark it as black (2).
4. If, during the DFS traversal, a gray vertex is encountered,
   it means a cycle has been detected.
