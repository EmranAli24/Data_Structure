# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) - Lecture Problem Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to the problems discussed in the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course during my third semester at the **University of Chittagong**. All solutions are primarily based on the lectures delivered by my course instructor.

## Acknowledgments

While working through this course, I took help and inspiration from various resources to deepen my understanding and solve the problems effectively. I would like to acknowledge the following:

- My **teacher’s lecture slides** from the University of Chittagong  
- **Abdul Bari’s lectures** on YouTube  
- **Jenny’s Lectures CS/IT**  
- **Take U Forward** (Striver’s DSA Series)  
- **GeeksforGeeks**  
- **ChatGPT** (used for clarification and problem-solving guidance)  
- Various other online articles, tutorials, and documentation  

These resources greatly enriched my learning and helped me gain a stronger grasp of DSA concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Lecture-wise Solutions**: Each lecture's problems are stored in separate folders.
- **Code Implementations**: Solutions are implemented in appropriate programming languages (e.g., C, C++, Java, or Python).
- **Explanations (if applicable)**: Some problems may include explanations or comments for better understanding.

## Topics Covered

The repository includes solutions for problems covering:

- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms  
- Recursion  
- Stack  
- Graph  
- Tree  
- Heap  
- Hashing  
- BST, AVL Tree  
- Huffman Coding
