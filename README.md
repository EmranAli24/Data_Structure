# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) - Lecture Problem Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to the problems discussed in the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course during my third semester at the **University of Chittagong**. All solutions are based on the lectures delivered by my course instructor.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **Lecture-wise Solutions**: Each lecture's problems are stored in separate folders.
- **Code Implementations**: Solutions are implemented in appropriate programming languages (e.g., C, C++, Java, or Python).
- **Explanations (if applicable)**: Some problems may include explanations or comments for better understanding.

## Topics Covered
The repository includes solutions for problems covering:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Recursion 


## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired topic or lecture folder.
3. Run the code using the appropriate compiler or interpreter.
